## 1️⃣ What is Competitive Programming?
Competitive Programming (CP) is like a sport for programmers. Participants compete to solve algorithmic problems within a set time limit.

- You **write and submit code** that is tested against multiple cases.
- Your goal: **Efficient and correct solutions**.
- Famous contests: **ICPC**, **Google Code Jam**, **Facebook HackerCup**, **Hashcode**, **Kickstart**.

---

## 2️⃣ Who Should Try CP?
- **Anyone** wanting to enhance problem-solving, analytical, and debugging skills.
- CP trains you to **think under pressure**, improving focus and coding speed.

---

## 3️⃣ Is CP Necessary for Placements?
❌ **Not mandatory**, but ✅ **highly recommended**:
- Boosts logical thinking & problem-solving.
- Prepares you for technical interviews.
- Builds a foundation for all tech domains.

---

## 4️⃣ Getting Started
1. Learn basics of **C++** or **Java** (preferred for CP).
2. Practice beginner-friendly problems on **HackerRank**.
3. Move to **Codeforces** for higher-quality contests.
4. Allocate:
   - **3-4 hours** → Problem-solving.
   - **1 hour** → Concept revision.

## 5️⃣ Recommended Platforms
| Platform     | Why Use It? |
|--------------|-------------|
| [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) | Frequent contests, virtual participation, quality problems. |
| [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/) | Good for long & short challenges, rating system. |
| [Topcoder](https://www.topcoder.com/) | Classic platform with diverse problems. |
| [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/) | Beginner to advanced problems, great DP practice. |

---

## 6️⃣ When to Start?
- **Best time:** _Now_.  
- Progress depends on **consistency**, not years of practice.

---

## 7️⃣ Prerequisites
- Basics of a programming language.
- Fundamental **DSA**: Arrays, Strings, basic Sorting, simple Math.
- Learn advanced topics while solving problems.

---

## 8️⃣ Approach to Solving Problems
1. **Read** the problem carefully.
2. **Note** important constraints.
3. **Estimate** expected time complexity.
4. **Formulate & optimize** the approach.
5. If stuck:
   - Take small hints.
   - Read part of the editorial.
   - If still stuck, study the full solution and make **short revision notes**.

---

## 9️⃣ Importance of Contests
- Simulates **real-time pressure**.
- Improves speed & accuracy.
- **Upsolve** after contests:
  - If you solved 2 problems in contest, solve at least 1 more afterward.

---

## 🔟 When You Can't Solve Problems
**Two scenarios**:
1. **New topic** → Learn it, then solve.
2. **Familiar topic but stuck** → Break into smaller tasks, take hints, discuss with peers.

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ Final Advice
- **Participate often** — live or virtual contests.
- Avoid waiting for the "perfect" time.
- Surround yourself with people passionate about CP.
