## üöÄ Learning Path for AI

Start with the basics and move step-by-step:

1. **Python** ‚Äì Learn syntax and key libraries like `NumPy`, `Pandas`, etc.
2. **Math & Statistics** ‚Äì Focus on linear algebra, probability, and core statistical concepts.
3. **Data Analysis** ‚Äì Learn how to explore, clean, and visualize data.
4. **Machine Learning** ‚Äì Understand key algorithms like regression, SVM, decision trees, etc.
5. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** ‚Äì Learn how machines understand and generate human language.
6. **Deep Learning** ‚Äì Dive into neural networks, CNNs, RNNs, and more.
7. **Generative AI** ‚Äì Work with transformers, LLMs, and tools like ChatGPT, DALL¬∑E, etc.

## üî¨ What‚Äôs Next?

There are several advanced and emerging concepts in AI ‚Äî such as **Agentic AI** and **Multi-Agent Collaboration Protocols (MCP)** ‚Äî that are gaining momentum. While I haven't explored these in depth yet, a solid command over the fundamentals will make learning these advanced topics much easier.

> **Note:** This is just the surface level. If you're aiming to build industry-grade solutions, it's important to eventually learn **MLOps** too.

<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Read at least one research paper related to your topic before writing code. Understand what‚Äôs been tried, what worked, and where there‚Äôs room to improve.</p>
<!-- Projects Guidance ‚Äî paste into your README.md -->
<h2>üöÄ Projects Guidance</h2>

<p>
A strong project is more than training a model ‚Äî it‚Äôs an <strong>end-to-end</strong> solution:
<em>preprocessing ‚Üí modeling ‚Üí evaluation ‚Üí comparison ‚Üí deployment</em> (Streamlit, FastAPI, etc.).
</p>


<ol>
  <li>
    <h3>1Ô∏è‚É£ Know Your Data</h3>
    <p>Your dataset is the foundation. The cleaner, more relevant, and better understood it is, the better your results.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Explore it.</strong> (EDA, distributions, missing values)</li>
      <li><strong>Identify issues.</strong> (bias, leakage, outliers)</li>
      <li><strong>Fix them before modeling.</strong> (cleaning, feature engineering)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h3>2Ô∏è‚É£ Test Before You Tweak</h3>
    <p>Avoid the rookie mistake of jumping straight to fancy techniques ‚ùå.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Start with a baseline model.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Apply new techniques only after measuring baseline performance.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Compare before vs. after</strong> ‚Äî that‚Äôs how you learn what actually improves results ‚úÖ.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h3>3Ô∏è‚É£ Learn from What‚Äôs Been Tried</h3>
    <p>Don‚Äôt reinvent the wheel.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use <a href="https://scholar.google.com" target="_blank">Google Scholar</a> to find similar problems.</li>
      <li>See what worked and what didn‚Äôt.</li>
      <li>Adapt proven techniques to your case. Reusing ideas in a new context is <em>smart research</em>, not plagiarism.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h3>4Ô∏è‚É£ Pick a Lane</h3>
    <p>AI is huge: <small>Data Analytics ¬∑ Machine Learning ¬∑ Computer Vision ¬∑ MLOps ¬∑ NLP ¬∑ Deep Learning ¬∑ Generative AI</small></p>
    <ul>
      <li>You can‚Äôt master everything ‚Äî and you don‚Äôt need to.</li>
      <li>Pick a subfield. Go deep. Build your personal brand there.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h3>5Ô∏è‚É£ Stay Technically Sharp & Aware</h3>
    <p>You don‚Äôt have to chase every hype, but awareness is power.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Track major trends (LLMs, AI Agents, MCPs).</li>
      <li>Know what‚Äôs relevant in your chosen subfield ‚Äî it helps you decide when to adopt new tools and when to ignore noise.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h3>6Ô∏è‚É£ Think Before You Build</h3>
    <p>In an AI boom, misinformation spreads fast. Strong fundamentals in ML, NLP, and DL make it easier to filter hype from substance.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<details>
  <summary><strong>üìå Examples</strong></summary>
  <ul>
    <li>Machine Learning + Data Imbalancing techniques (SMOTE, ADASYN)</li>
    <li>Natural Language Processing + Feature Engineering Pipeline</li>
    <li>Comparing traditional architectures like RNNs, CNNs, LSTMs with modern solutions like fine-tuned LLMs (e.g., BERT)</li>
    <li>Experimenting with model explainability tools like LIME, SHAP</li>
  </ul>
</details>

Learn to filter trends from genuine breakthroughs.

Try to relax, work on the fundamentals, read, explore, build and improve.
