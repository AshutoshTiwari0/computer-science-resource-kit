AI is booming right now. Focus on getting your basics right â€” itâ€™ll make learning advanced topics much easier and faster later on.

## ðŸš€ Learning Path for AI

Start with the basics and move step-by-step:

1. **Python** â€“ Learn syntax and key libraries like `NumPy`, `Pandas`, etc.
2. **Math & Statistics** â€“ Focus on linear algebra, probability, and core statistical concepts.
3. **Data Analysis** â€“ Learn how to explore, clean, and visualize data.
4. **Machine Learning** â€“ Understand key algorithms like regression, SVM, decision trees, etc.
5. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** â€“ Learn how machines understand and generate human language.
6. **Deep Learning** â€“ Dive into neural networks, CNNs, RNNs, and more.
7. **Generative AI** â€“ Work with transformers, LLMs, and tools like ChatGPT, DALLÂ·E, etc.

## ðŸ”¬ Whatâ€™s Next?

There are several advanced and emerging concepts in AI â€” such as **Agentic AI** and **Multi-Agent Collaboration Protocols (MCP)** â€” that are gaining momentum. While I haven't explored these in depth yet, a solid command over the fundamentals will make learning these advanced topics much easier.

> **Note:** This is just the surface level. If you're aiming to build industry-grade solutions, it's important to eventually learn **MLOps** too.
